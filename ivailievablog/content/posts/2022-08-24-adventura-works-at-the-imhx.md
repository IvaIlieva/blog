Between 6th and 8th September, you’ll find us at the The Logistics Solutions Show (IMHX) at the NEC, Birmingham - UK.

The IMHX is one of the most prestigious events for supply chain professionals, bringing the best solutions from suppliers all over the world.

From stand 5D96 we’ll be demonstrating a prototype of our innovative technology. Fitted with cameras and sensors, you’ll be able to experience the future of forklift teleoperation for yourself.

Co-founder and CEO Alexander Manolov says: “We’re pleased to be showcasing our new solution in the UK. We have consulted with many logistics and warehousing operatives who have all been affected by forklift driver shortages and there is a real need for technology to close the gap.

With our technology, our clients can improve efficiency and material handling throughput in the warehouse as well as reduce product damage.

The bottom line is: we can help our clients tackle the driver shortages while reducing 20-40% of their material handling costs.”

CTO and Co-founder Nikolai Penkov says: “Brexit has had a huge effect on skills shortages in the material handling industry. Back in 2019, there were over 7,000 unfilled forklift driver jobs and this has been made worse by Covid. AdVentura Works SA can help warehouses level themselves up to meet the growing demands of material handling.”

Highlights to look forward to:

On-stand interactive demonstration of forklift teleoperation technology, showcasing how remotely operated vehicles are set to transform warehouses for the better.
Watch CEO Alex Manolov take part in a ‘Power Pitch’ where he will have 3 minutes to impress a judging panel of industry experts.
Talk to us about the AW Review service; over a 4 week period our consultants will use data to analyse your existing material handling processes and identify opportunities for improvement.
We hope to see you at the IMHX, NEC between 6-8 September (Stand No: 5D96). If you’d like to pre-book a meeting with us at a time to suit you, get in touch.
