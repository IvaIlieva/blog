    text: "AdVentura Works, a Swiss technology company based in Morges, VD is exploring a new frontier in remote warehouse operations.

    Humans and technology combined have the potential to transform the way we live and work. Our mission is to unlock new business opportunities for our clients and be a reliable partner on their digital transformation journey.

    We are here to level up warehouses and distributors in the face of vast staff shortages by providing MHaaS (material handling as a service). Our remotely operated forklift trucks provide warehouse  operators flexibility, safety and cost saving.

    The vast data generated from our material handling technology data will  also help to optimise slotting processes and make warehouses more  efficient.

    We believe in customer-centricity and the scientific approach to innovation management  - forming business networks and collaborating to stay agile and solve business problems quickly."
